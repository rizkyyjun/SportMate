## Current Work Focus
Successfully resolved the issue with the chat list not displaying the creator's chat rooms. The frontend type definitions and component logic have been updated to correctly handle the `Message` object, ensuring that the chat list is now displayed correctly.

## Recent Changes
- Modified `SportMate/src/types/index.ts` to include the `createdAt` and `sender` properties in the `Message` interface.
- Modified `SportMate/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx` to correctly access the `sender` object and the `createdAt` timestamp.

## Next Steps
No immediate next steps for this task. The feature is implemented and verified.

## Important patterns and preferences
- The application uses React Navigation for screen navigation.
- User profile information is managed through the `AuthContext`.
- Backend routes and controllers are used to handle API requests for updating user data.

## Learnings and project insights
- It is important to ensure that the frontend and backend data structures are consistent.
- Mismatches between the two can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.
