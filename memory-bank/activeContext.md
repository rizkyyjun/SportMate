## Current Work Focus
Successfully implemented and verified the display of recipient's username and email in direct chat headers, both in the chat list and the room chat details screen. Also fixed the issue where deleted chat rooms were still displayed in the chat list. Removed all temporary debug logs. Additionally, removed the "User" prefix from the participant list in teammate request details.

## Recent Changes
- Modified `SportMate/src/services/chat.service.ts` to ensure `otherParticipant` is always set for direct chat rooms, and its `name` defaults to `email` if `name` is missing.
- Modified `SportMate/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx` to explicitly use the `otherParticipant` property from the `ChatRoom` object when constructing the chat room title and passing recipient information to `ChatRoomScreen`.
- Corrected `backend/src/controllers/chat.controller.ts` to use `TypeORM`'s `find` method with `relations` and `where` clauses to correctly load all participants for a chat room, resolving the issue where only the current user was being returned in the `participants` array. Also imported `In` from `typeorm` and removed a duplicate `res.json` call.
- Implemented logic in `backend/src/controllers/chat.controller.ts` within `removeParticipantFromChatRoom` to automatically delete a chat room and its associated messages if it becomes empty after a participant is removed.
- Removed all `console.log` debug statements from `SportMate/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`, `SportMate/src/services/chat.service.ts`, `backend/src/controllers/chat.controller.ts`, and `SportMate/src/screens/ChatRoomScreen.tsx`.
- Modified `SportMate/src/screens/TeammateDetailsScreen.tsx` to remove the "User" prefix from the participant's name display in the participant list.

## Next Steps
No immediate next steps for this task. The feature is implemented and verified.

## Important patterns and preferences
- The application uses React Navigation for screen navigation.
- Chat room headers are dynamically set using `navigation.setOptions`.
- `otherParticipant` is crucial for displaying recipient information in direct chat headers.
- Explicitly passing `currentUserId` to service functions improves reliability and type safety.
- Using `TypeORM`'s `find` method with `relations` is more reliable for loading full related entities than complex `createQueryBuilder` with `distinctOn` for nested relations.
- Automatic deletion of empty chat rooms ensures data consistency and a clean user experience.
- UI text should be concise and directly informative, avoiding redundant prefixes like "User" when the context is clear.

## Learnings and project insights
- Relying on `(api as any).defaults.headers.common['x-user-id']` for current user identification within service functions can be unreliable. Passing the `currentUserId` explicitly from the component (where `AuthContext` provides it) is a more robust approach.
- Always ensure that event handlers (like `onPress`) correctly match the expected function signature, especially when modifying function parameters.
- Pre-processing `otherParticipant` in the service layer simplifies component logic and ensures consistent data.
- Debugging backend data flow is crucial when frontend display issues persist despite seemingly correct frontend logic.
- TypeORM's `createQueryBuilder` with `distinctOn` can be tricky with complex relations; `find` with `relations` can be a simpler and more effective alternative for hydrating related entities.
- Proper handling of chat room deletion on the backend is essential for maintaining data integrity and accurate frontend display.
- Small UI text adjustments can significantly improve user experience and clarity.
