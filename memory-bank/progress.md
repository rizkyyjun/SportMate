# Progress

## What Works
- User authentication is functional.
- Field creation is now restricted to administrators.
- An "Add New Field" button is conditionally displayed on the Field List screen for administrators, navigating to a `CreateFieldScreen`.
- A placeholder `CreateFieldScreen.tsx` component has been created.
- Direct chat headers in both the chat list and chat room details screen now display the recipient's username and email.
- All temporary debug logs have been removed.
- The "User" prefix has been removed from the participant list in teammate request details.

## What's Left to Build
- The `CreateFieldScreen` component itself needs to be implemented with the actual form for creating a new field.

## Current Status
- Feature implemented and verified. Debug logs removed. UI text adjusted.

## Known Issues
- None at this time.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations like field creation has been implemented.
- UI elements for administrative actions are conditionally rendered based on user role.
- Improved chat header information for direct messages to enhance user experience.
- Refined backend data fetching for chat rooms to ensure complete participant information is always available.
- Enhanced clarity of participant display in teammate request details.
