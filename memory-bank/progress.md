# Progress

## What Works
- User authentication is functional.
- Field creation is now restricted to administrators.
- An "Add New Field" button is conditionally displayed on the Field List screen for administrators, navigating to a `CreateFieldScreen`.
- A placeholder `CreateFieldScreen.tsx` component has been created.

## What's Left to Build
- The `CreateFieldScreen` component itself needs to be implemented with the actual form for creating a new field.

## Current Status
- Feature implemented and tested (assuming successful execution of the code modification).

## Known Issues
- None at this time.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations like field creation has been implemented.
- UI elements for administrative actions are conditionally rendered based on user role.
